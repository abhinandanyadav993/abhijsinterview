1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Theory Questions
Q1: What is the main difference between map, filter, and reduce in JavaScript?

Q2: What does the map() method return if you don‚Äôt include a return statement inside the callback?

Q3: Can filter() change the length of the array? Why or why not?

Q4: What is the default value (initialValue) used for in reduce(), and what happens if you omit it?

Q5: Are map, filter, and reduce chainable? Why?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Return & Behavior Focused Coding Questions
Q6: What will the following code return?

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const result = arr.map(num => {
  num * 2;
});
console.log(result);
(Expected answer: [undefined, undefined, undefined] because of missing return in the arrow function block.)

Q7: What will this filter() return?

const arr = [10, 20, 30];
const result = arr.filter(num => {
  num > 15;
});
console.log(result);
(Expected answer: [] ‚Äî no return, so it‚Äôs always falsy.)

Q8: What is the return type of reduce()? Give an example of reducing an array of numbers to a string.

Q9: Predict the output:

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const result = nums.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
console.log(result);
(Expected answer: 10)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Problem-Solving Questions
Q10: Using map(), return an array of string lengths from this array:

["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
(Expected: [5, 6, 6])

Q11: Using filter(), return only even numbers from this array:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Q12: Using reduce(), flatten the following array:

[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
(Expected: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

Q13: Write a single chain of map, filter, and reduce that doubles numbers, filters out odd numbers, and sums the result from:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
4Ô∏è‚É£ Edge Cases & Debugging
Q14: What happens if you map() an empty array? Does the callback get executed?

Q15: Explain why this code gives an unexpected result:

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const result = arr.map((num) => {
  return;
});
console.log(result);
(Expected: [undefined, undefined, undefined] because return; returns undefined.)




Advanced Logical Questions
Q1: You have a deeply nested array of numbers like:

js
Copy
Edit
[1, [2, [3, [4, 5]]]]
Write a reduce-based function to completely flatten it into:

js
Copy
Edit
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Q2: Without using flatMap, implement the functionality of flatMap using map and reduce combined.

Q3: How would you use reduce to group an array of objects by a property? For example:

js
Copy
Edit
[{type: 'fruit', name: 'apple'}, {type: 'vegetable', name: 'carrot'}, {type: 'fruit', name: 'banana'}]
Into:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  fruit: ['apple', 'banana'],
  vegetable: ['carrot']
}
Q4: Consider a list of asynchronous functions (returning Promises). How can you chain them sequentially using reduce, ensuring each one waits for the previous to finish?

Q5: You have an array of numbers, but you want to create a reduce that finds both the min and max in one pass, returning {min, max}. Write it in a concise way.

Q6: How can you implement a lazy evaluation pipeline using map and filter that only processes data when explicitly requested (similar to streams)?

Q7: You need to count how many times each unique word appears in a string using a combination of split, map, and reduce. What‚Äôs your approach?

Q8: Suppose you have two arrays:

js
Copy
Edit
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];  
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
How can you write a reduce that merges them into a single array of paired objects like:

js
Copy
Edit
[{a: 1, b: 4}, {a: 2, b: 5}, {a: 3, b: 6}]
Q9: Imagine you have a very large dataset (millions of records). What performance considerations or alternatives would you think about before using map, filter, or reduce directly? How could you handle it efficiently?

Q10: Can you write a custom implementation of map (let's call it myMap) using reduce?

Do you want detailed answers for each of these advanced questions too?
